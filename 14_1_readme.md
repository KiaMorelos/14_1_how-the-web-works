# How the Web Works

- Hyper Text Transfer Protocol
The protocol through which a browswer and a server can exchange information/data 

- Uniform Resource Locator
An address that to a resource like a file, or images.

- Domain Name System
Is the way we can acess a website if it exists. It's like a directory

- Query Strings
Commonly seen when using a search form, it's looking for something. Usually preceded by a ? 

- Two HTTP verbs
POST AND GET.
POST changes/updated information on the server.
GET just retrieves information.

- An HTTP request
A request from a browser, or other client that asks for a resource on a server somewhere.

- An HTTP response
Gives back the content requested, and some type of response code depending on whether it succeeded in retrieving what it was asked for.

- An HTTP Header
Contains meta data about the HTTP response. Contains information about language preferences, the date and time, the type of contents
I have seen content-type headers, date and time headers.

- The processes
The url is parsed into an ip address. The page is checked for in the local computer cache first to see if it seen it before, then it moves on to the router, the internet service provider, and then lastly the DNS to if it exists.  If it exists the HTTP request and response is sent, otherwise a response code 404 is sent back.
